My name is Jacob Håkansson and I am a Software Engineer from Stockholm, Sweden.
I'm always interested in new technology, and particularly developing software.
Hopefully you'll find something of interest on this site, where I'll post stuff that might be of use for others.

If you want to learn more about me, there will be more info on this site in the near future. For now, contact me:
